### OCaml-makefile

A simple Makefile generator for OCaml projects

### Status

This is an experimental project to play with few ideas. Patches and ideas are welcome.

### How to use it

You can find few examples in the `examples/` directory, where projects are built using
multiple local libraries and ocamlfind libraries and syntax extensions. To generate a
Makefile for a given project, simply run `ocaml make.ml`.
